**Key Concepts:**
- Predictive scaling
- Cost optimization
- Performance monitoring
- Dynamic configuration

### 3. Automated Incident Response Demo
**Duration:** 10-15 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Intermediate  
**File:** [incident-response.md](./incident-response.md)

Illustrates an agent handling a production incident from detection to resolution.

**Key Concepts:**
- Anomaly detection
- Automated diagnostics
- Remediation strategies
- Escalation logic

## Demo Prerequisites

### General Requirements
- GitHub account with repository access
- Basic familiarity with CI/CD concepts
- Terminal/command line access
- Internet connection

### Specific Tools (depending on demo)
- Docker Desktop
- Python 3.8+
- Azure CLI or AWS CLI (for cloud demos)
- kubectl (for Kubernetes demos)

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the demo repository
2. Install required dependencies
3. Configure credentials
4. Test the demo environment
5. Review the demo script

Detailed setup for each demo is in the respective demo file.

## Tips for Successful Demos

### Before the Demo
- [ ] Test the entire demo at least once
- [ ] Have a backup video recording
- [ ] Prepare fallback slides if live demo fails
- [ ] Clear your terminal history
- [ ] Close unnecessary applications
- [ ] Check your internet connection

### During the Demo
- Narrate what you're doing
- Keep demos short and focused
- Have checkpoints where you pause for questions
- Use large fonts in terminal (18pt or larger)
- Zoom in on important output
- Explain what should happen before it happens

### If Something Goes Wrong
- Stay calm and use your backup video
- Use pre-prepared screenshots
- Skip to the next checkpoint
- Explain what would have happened
- Continue with the rest of the demo

## Demo Variations

### 30-Minute Session
- Choose 1 demo
- Keep it simple
- Focus on concepts over implementation

### 60-Minute Session
- Include 2 demos
- Add more technical depth
- Show configuration details

### Workshop Format
- All 3 demos
- Hands-on exercises
- Troubleshooting practice
- Group discussions

## Recording Demos

If you want to record demos for backup or asynchronous viewing:

1. Use high-quality screen recording software
2. Record audio separately for better quality
3. Keep recordings under 10 minutes each
4. Add captions or annotations
5. Test playback before the event

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Demo environment not working:**
- Check all prerequisites are installed
- Verify credentials are configured
- Review firewall/network settings
- Try the quick-start script

**Agents not responding:**
- Check agent logs
- Verify webhook configurations
- Test API connectivity
- Confirm permissions

**Performance issues:**
- Close resource-intensive applications
- Use a local environment instead of remote
- Reduce demo complexity
- Pre-warm services before demo
